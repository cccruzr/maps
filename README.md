Maps portfolio repository. Here you can find the source code for my free-time web mapping projects.

### List of web maps
1. [Conflict mapping: Colombia's massacres](https://cccruzr.github.io/maps/docs/masacres): This web map is based on the information collected by [*Rutas del conflicto*](http://rutasdelconflicto.com/), whose work is related with data-driven journalism to the construction of historical memory related with the armed conflict in Colombia.


2. [CÃ³digo Postal Colombia](https://cccruzr.github.io/maps/CodigoPostalCO/): A lightweight, mobile-friendly and more intuitive alternative to look up for the recently updated postal codes in Colombia.
